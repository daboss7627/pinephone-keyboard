Firmware
--------

- mask R5:C4 and R4:C2 because these are always on on my prototype
  and prevent development of idle functionality
  (Z key is stuck)

- sleep when no key is pressed and wakeup using pin change interrupt
  on P6 port

- wakeup on I2C activity only happens on device address match, so
  we can only sleep again after the entire transfer completes (how
  to detect that though?)

USB Flashing Tool
-----------------

- investigate reason for URB errors/empty (in command status INT transfer)


Userspace input device daemon
-----------------------------

- allow to read keymap config from a file instead of compiling it in

- improve combo key handling
  - sticky keys entry mode?

- add various modal modes:
  - show modal hints on the display 
    - write to linux console framebuffer directly
    - run a generic process/script (eg. to show mode in i3 status bar)

Modes:

- navigation mode arrows work as arrows without holding Fn key, holding
  Fn key inverts the meaning to primary (so Fn+Up types a 'dot')
- sticky Fn mode (all keys act as if Fn is being held)
- sticky keys mode (build a multi-key shortcut gradually, without having to
  hold multiple keys at once)
- ???
